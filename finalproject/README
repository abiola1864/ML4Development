The codes can ve found in anaemia.ipynb and malnutrition.ipynb, respectively for both outcome variables we test our models with. 

For the data, please download the ANAEMIA and MALNUTRITION csv files using the following google drive link. 

https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/180JmxxCySGN2LUZyrVt45LeYza0t3pT8

Once these two files are saved in the evaluator's computer, the code will allow to select from computer files and choose each respective file. 

As expected, please run the MALNUTRITION csv file in the malnutrition.ipynb code and the ANAEMIA csv file in the anaemia.ipynb code. 

Lastly, please change the file path in the code to match where it is stored in your computer. The rest has been adapted to make it as smooth as possible.

THANK YOU!
